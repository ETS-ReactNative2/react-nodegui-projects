# React Node GUI Projects
Explores core React flavor of Node GUI, its capabilities and limitations. This repo contains examples of how React Node GUI utilizes the same patterns you'd normally find in plain React.

1. Basics - Initial setup after a **git clone** of their starter project, then **npm install**, **npm run dev** and **npm start** in a separate tab. Folder contains React Node GUI example from their website. See how components from Qt are imported. NOTE: All CSS styling via React Node GUI is internal - therefore you CANNOT import external stylesheets or use bootstrapped components like Material UI or Bootstrap.

2. Bare Bones Starter - All the files and folders you would need on a React Node GUI project. This starter is a bare minimum, unopinionated solution without State Management or Styling. Important to use this version over Create React App as running that command (even with React Node GUI flags) does not produce necessary scripts for **npm run dev**.

3. React Hooks API - Basic examples of how using functional hooks like useState, useRef, useEffect, useReducer and useContext look inside of a React Node GUI project.

4. React Node GUI Elements & Events - TBD.

5. AJAX - TBD.

6. Forms - TBD.

7. Fragments & Portals - TBD.

8. Selective Re-Render Techniques - TBD.

9. Redux, Toolkit, React-Redux & Async Patterns - TBD.

10. Routing - TBD.



### Capabilities
- Fast and Performant native desktop apps made with React.
- Alternatives like Electron are much slower and have a higher memory cost in comparison.
- Able to use the NPM library to build native desktop apps.

### Limitations
- Limited Development Support; No team to maintain React Node GUI or its GitHub issues.
- Tied to the React ecosystem and Node runtime where modern versions of React or Node may not be backwards compatible with React Node GUI.
