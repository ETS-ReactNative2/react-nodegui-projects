# React Node GUI Projects
Explores the React flavor of Node GUI, its capabilities and limitations for native desktop applications.

1. Basics - Initial setup after a **git clone** of their starter project, then **npm install**, **npm run dev** and **npm start** in a separate tab. Folder contains React Node GUI example from their website. See how components from Qt are imported. NOTE: All CSS styling via React Node GUI is internal - therefore you CANNOT import external stylesheets or use bootstrapped components like Material UI or Bootstrap.

2. Bare Bones Starter - All the files and folders you would need on a React Node GUI project. This starter is a bare minimum, unopinionated solution without State Management or Styling. Important to use this version over Create React App as running that command (even with React Node GUI flags) does not produce necessary scripts for **npm run dev**.

3. Hooks API & Events - Basic examples of how using essential React Hooks API and React Node GUI Events look like inside of a React Node GUI project.


### Capabilities
- Fast and Performant native desktop apps made with React.
- Alternatives like Electron are much slower and have a higher memory cost in comparison.
- Able to use the NPM library to build native desktop apps.
- Easier to reason about a component-based application in comparison to Node GUI where Node was never a Front End technology.

### Limitations
- Learning how to style Qt components takes you back to learning CSS all over again.
- At times you will need to read between three separate pieces of documentation from React Node GUI, Node GUI and Qt Docs.
- Not able to use boostrapped component libraries like Material UI.
- Limited Developer Maintainer Support; No team to maintain React Node GUI or its GitHub issues.
